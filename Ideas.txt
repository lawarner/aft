Tests can invoke other tests, either synchronously or threaded.
Threaded tests can interact with each other.

Actor:  Can be another test or just a set of behaviors
Bound:  How far test objects can reach

TestObject: Actor, Command, Element, Endpoint, Logic (Process, Fork), Transport
            Notice (Alert, Exception, Message), Lookup (Database, ...)
            Location, Bound
            TestCase, TestBundle, Log, Result

Import hints for tests from unit tests defined using googletest, or other framework.
