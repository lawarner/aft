 *  @brief AFT : Abstract Framework for Testing
 *
 *  AFT is a low-level, portable framework used to automate executing various
 *  system and module tests.  Although the majority of classes are abstract,
 *  implementations are provided using standard C++ and STL.  For platform specific
 *  code, AFT supports a plug-in architecture.
